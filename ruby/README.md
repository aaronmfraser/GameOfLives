# Ruby Game of Life

This was to warm up my ruby muscles and to get the rules down

The plotting and test code was borrowed from [elisehuard](https://github.com/elisehuard)'s [Game Of Life](https://github.com/elisehuard/game_of_life) repository

To see it in action, run:

    ruby run.rb    

This requires the ffi-ncurses ruby gem

    gem install ffi ffi-ncurses
